    The given program cannot be stratified due to recursivity.

    When using probabilistic queries, a query can

    probabilistic query dependency, no probabilistic predicate should appear
    in the stratum that depends on the query.
    The same holds for aggregate or negated queries. If a rule contains an
    aggregate or negated term, all the predicates in the body of the rule
    must be computed in a previous stratum.

    Examples
    --------
    B(x) :- A(x), C(x)
    A(x) :- B(x)

    This program cannot be stratified because it contains a loop in
    the dependencies of each rule. Rule `B(x) :- A(x), C(x)` depends
    on the second rule through its occurence of the predicate `A(x)`.

    The given Datalog program is not valid for aggregation. Support for

    In other terms, all the predicates in the body of a rule containing an
