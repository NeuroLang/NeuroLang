Get Started with NeuroLang
==========================


First Steps With NeuroLang
--------------------------
NeuroLang is a unifying formalism to perform complex queries and explorations using heterogeneous data sources like tabular data,
volumetric images, and ontologies. To perform this in sound manner, NeuroLang is a probabilistic logic programming language based on Datalog [abiteboul1995]_, [maier2018]_. 


The whole idea of logic programming is to be able to make assertions of the style:

  region `x` is a left hemisphere gyrus **if** the label of `x` in Destrieux et al's atlas starts with "L G".

which can be formalised in first order logic as

.. math::
  
   (\forall x) \operatorname{left\_hemisphere\_gyrus}(x) \leftarrow (\exists l) \operatorname{region}(x) \wedge \operatorname{destrieux\_label}(l, x) \wedge \operatorname{startswith}('L\, G', l)


which, if we assume that :math:`x` being on Destrieux et al's atlas means that :math:`x` is already a region, can be shortened as

.. math::
  
   (\forall x) \operatorname{left\_hemisphere\_gyrus}(x) \leftarrow (\exists l)  \operatorname{destrieux\_atlas}(l, x) \wedge \operatorname{startswith}('L\,G', l)


Finally, for notation convenience, we will drop the quantifiers, assuming that all variable on the left of the arrow (such as :math:`x`) is universally quantified, and all variable appearing only on the right of the arrow (such as :math:`l`) will be existentially quantified [maier2018]_. This leads to the expression 


.. math::
  
   \operatorname{left\_hemisphere\_gyrus}(x) \leftarrow  \operatorname{destrieux\_atlas}(l, x) \wedge \operatorname{startswith}('L\,G', l)


which we formalise in python as:

.. code-block:: python

  with neurolang.scope as e:
      e.left_hemisphere_gyrus[e.x] = (
          e.destrieux_atlas(e.l, e.x) &
          e.startswith('L G', e.l)
      )


the full example is in our gallery in :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_plot_load_destrieux_left_hemisphere_gyri.py`.


Negation can also be used in Neurolang. For instance


Disjunctions in Logic Programming
.................................


Disjunctions in logic programming merit are a very specific case. For instance, let's say that all the regions in the left hemisphere's cortex are either a sulcus or gyrus, or more specifically

   x is a left hemisphere region **if** x is left sulcus **or** x is left gyrus

which in first order logic can be formalised as

.. math::

  (\forall x)\operatorname{left\_hemisphere\_region}(x) \leftarrow \operatorname{left\_hemisphere\_sulcus}(x) \vee \operatorname{left\_hemisphere\_gyrus}(x)


alternatively, this can be written as a set of two propositions

.. math::

 \begin{cases}
  (\forall x)\operatorname{left\_hemisphere\_region}(x) \leftarrow \operatorname{left\_hemisphere\_sulcus}(x)\\
  (\forall x)\operatorname{left\_hemisphere\_region}(x) \leftarrow  \operatorname{left\_hemisphere\_gyrus}(x)
 \end{cases}


which we formalise in Neurlang in the classical logical programming syntax:

.. code-block:: python

  with neurolang.scope as e:
      e.left_hemisphere_region[e.x] = e.left_hemisphere_sulcus(e.x)
      e.left_hemisphere_region[e.x] = e.left_hemisphere_gyrus(e.x) 



or in a less verbose manner:

.. code-block:: python

  with neurolang.scope as e:
      e.left_hemisphere_region[e.x] = e.left_hemisphere_sulcus(e.x) | e.left_hemisphere_gyrus(e.x)



The Case of Negation
.....................

Negation in logic programming needs special observance. We assume a *close world*
viewpoint of the world. This means that can only predicate on things we know.
As a consequence, if a predicate is negated using the operator :code:`~`, then 
at lest one variable of the negated predicate needs to be present in a positive predicate. 
Take into account the following query

.. code-block:: python

  @neurolang.add_symbol
  def even(x: int) -> bool:
      return x % 2 == 0

  with neurolang.scope as e:
      e.odd[e.x] = ~e.even[e.x]

      res = neurolang.query(e.x, e.odd(e.x))


is not a *valid* logic program as we don't know anyhing *positive* about `e.x`.
However if we restrict the domain of `x` as being between one and ten:

.. code-block:: python

  between_one_and_ten = nl.add_tuple_set([(x,) for x in range(1, 10)])

  with neurolang.scope as e:
      e.odd[e.x] = ~e.even[e.x]

      res = neurolang.query(
          e.x, 
          between_one_and_ten(e.x) & e.odd(e.x)
      )

we will obtain the set of tuples :code:`{(1,), (3,), (5,), (7,), (9,)}`

Aggregations
............

Aggregations combine information from a set of tuples. A good example of an aggregation is the maximum. As a mathematical definition we could define an aggregation as

.. math::

  \begin{split}
  (\forall country)\operatorname{max\_population\_per\_country}\left(country, max(\{pop: (\exists province)\operatorname{population\_per\_country\_province}(country, province, pop)\})\right) \leftarrow \\
  (\exists province)(\exists pop)\operatorname{population\_per\_country\_province}(country, province, pop)
  \end{split}

which in neurolang is expressed as

.. code-block:: python

   with neurolang.scope as e:
       e.max_population_per_country[e.country, e.max(e.pop)] = e.population_per_country_province(e.country, e.province, e.pop)


Syntactic Sugar
...............


Some syntactic sugar has been included to make queries easier to write.

Use First Column to Reference Second in a Set
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When a set has only two columns you can use the first to identify elements in
the second one. For instance if you have a set with regions in an altas


.. list-table:: Destrieux
   :widths: 5 5
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Region Name
     - Region
   * - "Central Sulcus"
     - R1


Then the following query

.. code-block:: python
   
    with neurolang.scope as e:
        e.central[e.x] = Destrieux.s["Central Sulcus"] == e.x


Is equivalent to 

.. code-block:: python
   
    with neurolang.scope as e:
        e.central[e.x] = Destrieux["Central Sulcus", e.x]

for an example of application see :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_plot_sulcal_queries.py` .


Logical Quantifiers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Assume that you want the most anterior region in Destrieux et al's atlas. Then,
a way to phrase it is

 The most anterior region `r` is such that `r` belongs to Destrieux's atlas and
 no existing region `q` in Destrieux's atlas is different from `r` and anterior to it.

we can formalise it as

.. code-block :: python

    with neurolang.scope as e:
        e.most_anterior[e.r] = (
            Destrieux[..., e.r] &
            ~neurolang.exists(
                e.q,
                Destrieux(..., e.q) & (e.r != e.q) &
                e.anterior_of(e.q, e.r)
            )
        )
