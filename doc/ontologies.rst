Ontologies
==========

Which answers does a query owe when the data are incomplete and an ontology
says what must exist beyond them?  The classical answer, a rewriting of the
query into a union of conjunctive queries, is finite only for restricted
ontology languages and can be exponential even there.  NeuroLang chases the
axioms that create no value as Datalog rules, and rewrites the query with
the others by XRewrite [Gottlob2014]_.

This page states what that procedure computes, why it is split in two, for
which ontologies its answers are complete, and what negation, aggregation
and probabilities mean over the predicates of an ontology.  The approach,
and its use on neuroscience ontologies, is described in [Zanitti2023]_.

Three instances
---------------

Three ontologies are used throughout this page.

(I) *Deans and units*.  Every dean heads a department, and every
department is a unit:

.. code-block:: turtle

   @prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .
   @prefix owl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#> .
   @prefix : <http://ex.org/> .
   :Dean a owl:Class ; rdfs:subClassOf [
       a owl:Restriction ; owl:onProperty :headOf ; owl:someValuesFrom :Dept
   ] .
   :Dept a owl:Class ; rdfs:subClassOf :Unit .
   :Unit a owl:Class .

with the facts ``Dean('Juan')``, ``headOf('Ana', 'Physics')`` and
``Dept('Physics')``.  Nothing names the department Juan heads.

(II) *A class closed under a property*.  ``A ⊑ ∀p.A``, where ``A`` is a
class and ``p`` a property: whatever an ``A`` reaches through ``p`` is an
``A``.  On the facts ``A(a0)`` and ``p(a0, a1)``, …, ``p(an-1, an)``, with
``a0`` to ``an`` named values, every ``ai`` is an ``A``.

(III) *The Cognitive Atlas*.  The ``neurosynth`` and ``neurostore`` engines
load ``cogat.v2.owl`` (see :doc:`tutorial_cognitive_atlas`).  It gives
10,399 constraints: three for each of its 2,724 ``someValuesFrom``
restrictions, one for each of its 1,797 subclass axioms and 430
``allValuesFrom`` restrictions.  The 430
``allValuesFrom`` constraints lie in one recursive component of 3,364
predicates.  The engine has no instance of any class.  We add one, of the
class ``CAO_01600``, to measure what happens when data meets the hierarchy.
The restrictions themselves are facts on class names; the 323
``someValuesFrom`` restrictions on ``ro:has_part`` are:

.. nl-repl::

   ans(c, d) :- rdfs:subClassOf(c, r),
       owl:onProperty(r, <http://www.obofoundry.org/ro/ro.owl#has_part>),
       owl:someValuesFrom(r, d)

These instances cover what the procedure must handle: a value no fact names
in (I), a recursion in (II), and the size of a real ontology in (III).

Loading an ontology
-------------------

:meth:`~neurolang.frontend.NeurolangPDL.load_ontology` reads OWL or RDF
files with rdflib and splits them in two.  The *TBox*, the axioms on classes,
becomes constraints, ``body → head`` implications kept apart from the rules
of the program.  The *ABox*, the facts on individuals, becomes relations: the
data added with ``add_tuple_set``, or, with ``individuals=True``, every triple
``s p o`` as the fact ``p(s, o)`` and every ``s rdf:type C`` also as
``C(s)``.  On (I), with the Turtle above in ``deans.ttl`` and loaded from
Python as in :ref:`python-ontology`:

.. code-block:: python

   from neurolang.frontend import NeurolangPDL

   nl = NeurolangPDL()
   nl.load_ontology("deans.ttl")
   nl.add_tuple_set([("Juan",)], name="Dean")
   nl.add_tuple_set([("Ana", "Physics")], name="headOf")
   nl.add_tuple_set([("Physics",)], name="Dept")

:class:`~neurolang.datalog.ontologies_parser.OntologyParser` reads the
axioms of each class ``C`` as follows, where ``x`` and ``y`` are variables,
``p`` a property, ``D`` and ``B`` classes, ``v`` a value and ``aux`` a fresh
predicate:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 45 55

   * - OWL axiom
     - constraints
   * - ``C rdfs:subClassOf D``
     - ``C(x) → D(x)``
   * - ``C ⊑ ∃p.D`` (``someValuesFrom``)
     - ``C(x) → ∃y aux(x, y)``, ``aux(x, y) → p(x, y)``,
       ``aux(x, y) → D(y)``
   * - ``C ⊑ ∀p.D`` (``allValuesFrom``)
     - ``C(x) ∧ p(x, y) → D(y)``
   * - ``C ⊑ ∃p.{v}`` (``hasValue``)
     - ``C(x) → p(x, v)``
   * - ``C ⊑ B ⊓ ∃p.D`` (``intersectionOf``)
     - ``C(x) → B(x)`` and the ``someValuesFrom`` constraints
   * - annotation ``C p v``, as ``rdfs:label``
     - ``C(x) → p(x, v)``

Furthermore, the structure of the TBox is kept as facts on class names,
``neurolang:subClassOf('C', 'D')`` and ``neurolang:label('C', 'v')``, so a
query can walk the hierarchy itself.  ``unionOf``, ``complementOf``,
``equivalentClass``, enumerated classes and cardinality restrictions are
read with a warning and dropped; property axioms (``subPropertyOf``,
``domain``, ``range``, ``inverseOf``, transitivity) are not read.  Dropping
an axiom removes answers, never adds one.  Hence the constraints NeuroLang
uses are a subset of the ontology's, and every answer is entailed by the
ontology.

Open world and certain answers
------------------------------

A relation of a Datalog program is closed: what is not derived is false.
An ontology is read under the open-world assumption: the facts are a part of
the world, and the constraints say what else the world must contain.  The
answers a query owes are its *certain answers*, the tuples of named values
true in every world that contains the facts and satisfies the constraints.

The *chase* computes them [Fagin2005]_.  It applies each constraint whose
body holds and whose head does not, and stands an unnamed value, a labelled
null, for each ``∃y``.  Its result, the universal model, maps into every
world of the ontology.  Hence a query's certain answers are its answers on
the universal model with no unnamed value [Cali2013]_.

On (I), the chase adds ``aux('Juan', n1)``, ``headOf('Juan', n1)``,
``Dept(n1)`` and ``Unit(n1)``, with ``n1`` unnamed, and ``Unit('Physics')``.
The query

.. code-block:: neurolang

   ans(x) :- headOf(x, y), Unit(y)

has the certain answers ``Ana`` and ``Juan``; ``ans(x, y) :- headOf(x, y),
Unit(y)`` has only ``('Ana', 'Physics')``, as Juan's department has no name.
A constraint ``C ⊑ ∃p.C`` makes the chase infinite, so it is not run as such.
NeuroLang runs the part of it that ends, and rewrites the query for the
rest.

Two mechanisms
--------------

A constraint is *full* if every variable of its head is in its body; it is
*existential* otherwise.  Subclass, ``allValuesFrom``, ``hasValue``,
annotation and ``aux(x, y) → p(x, y)`` constraints are full; ``C(x) → ∃y
aux(x, y)`` is existential.

**The chase of full constraints.**  A full constraint is a Datalog rule:
``Dept(x) → Unit(x)`` is ``Unit(x) :- Dept(x)``.  Its chase creates no value
and ends, and its result is the least model of the rules.  NeuroLang adds to
the program of a query the full constraints its predicates depend on, among
those whose body can hold from the predicates with facts or rules.  A
predicate with facts that such a rule derives is replaced, in the rules of
the query, by a copy holding its facts and what the rules derive, as Datalog
does not let a rule derive into a relation of facts.

**The rewriting of existential constraints.**  XRewrite [Gottlob2011]_
[Gottlob2014]_ replaces a query atom by the body of a constraint whose head
unifies with it.  An existential constraint applies only if the variable in
its ``∃`` position is a variable of the query that occurs nowhere else and is
not in the head.  A *factorisation* step first unifies atoms that share that
variable.  On (I), the rewriting of the query is the union of eight
rules, among which

.. code-block:: neurolang

   ans(x) :- headOf(x, y), Unit(y)
   ans(x) :- headOf(x, y), Dept(y)
   ans(x) :- aux(x, y), Dept(y)
   ans(x) :- aux(x, y), aux(z, y)
   ans(x) :- aux(x, y)
   ans(x) :- Dean(x)

``Unit(y)`` becomes ``Dept(y)``, then ``aux(z, y)`` by the
full constraint ``aux(z, y) → Dept(y)``; the two ``aux`` atoms are factorised
into ``aux(x, y)``, where ``y`` occurs once; finally, the existential
constraint rewrites ``aux(x, y)`` into ``Dean(x)``.  The rules over
``aux``, which has no values, are dropped before evaluation.

**The split.**  Full constraints are in the rewriting too: (I) needs
``Dept ⊑ Unit`` applied to Juan's unnamed department, which the chase never
creates.  However, they rewrite only an atom with a variable out of the
rule's head, the only kind of atom that can stand for an unnamed value.  An
atom whose variables are all in the head, as ``Dean(x)`` above, stands for
named values only, on which the chase has already applied every full
constraint.  The rewritings left are evaluated, with the chased rules, by
NeuroLang's Datalog engine.  Hence each full constraint reaches the named
values through the chase, and the unnamed ones only through the atoms that
can stand for them.

Why split
---------

A union of conjunctive queries is a first-order query.  Hence a finite
rewriting exists only if the certain answers are first-order definable, and
XRewrite ends only when one exists.  Linear and sticky constraints
[Cali2012]_ [Cali2012b]_, among which the DL-Lite family behind OWL 2 QL
[Calvanese2007]_, have that property.  ``allValuesFrom`` does not.  On (II),
``A(ai)`` holds exactly when ``ai`` is reachable from an ``A`` through ``p``.
Reachability is not first-order definable, so no union of conjunctive
queries gives the certain answers of ``ans(x) :- A(x)``; XRewrite produces
``A(x)``, ``A(z) ∧ p(z, x)``, ``A(z) ∧ p(z, w) ∧ p(w, x)``, … without end.
The chase computes it as the transitive closure it is.

Moreover, where the rewriting is finite it can be exponential in the
query: each atom is replaced by any of the classes below its own, and the
alternatives multiply across atoms [Calvanese2007]_.

(III) shows both effects.  The query ``ans(x) :- ro:has_part(x, y)`` is
rewritten with the constraints whose body can hold: none without an
instance, so it runs in 0.7 s.  One instance of ``CAO_01600`` makes 8,560 of
the 10,399 constraints hold.  Rewriting with all of them, as NeuroLang did
before the split, did not end within 120 s.  With the split, the full
constraints run in the chase, the rewriting holds 333 conjunctive queries,
built in 0.8 s, and the query returns the instance in 1.7 s.  rdflib gives
the same answer: a superclass of ``CAO_01600`` has a ``someValuesFrom``
restriction on ``ro:has_part``.

.. list-table:: Time of a query, with one instance of ``CAO_01600``
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 70 15 15

   * - query
     - before
     - after
   * - ``ans(x) :- ro:has_part(x, y)``
     - > 120 s
     - 1.7 s
   * - ``ans(x) :- ro:part_of(x, y)``
     - > 120 s
     - 2.3 s
   * - ``ans(x, y) :- ro:part_of(x, y)``
     - 3.0 s
     - 1.3 s
   * - ``ans(n) :- AGGREGATE[](skos:Concept(c) @ count(c)) = n``
     - > 120 s
     - 1.8 s
   * - ``ans(t) :- cogat_term(c, 'language comprehension'),
       ro:has_part(c, x), cogat_term(x, t)``
     - 13.0 s
     - 2.4 s

Without the instance, the five queries keep their answers and their times,
under 2 s.  The chase takes the recursion and the hierarchy; the rewriting
is left with the values the existential constraints create.

When the answers are complete
-----------------------------

The answers are always sound: a chased rule and a rewriting step each derive
only what the ontology entails, and dropping a step only loses answers.
They are the certain answers under three assumptions.

Firstly, the constraints are Horn: one atom in each head, no disjunction.
With ``unionOf`` on the right of a subclass axiom, query answering is
coNP-hard in the data [Calvanese2013]_, and, unless PTime = coNP, no
Datalog program computes it.
NeuroLang drops these axioms, so its answers are then incomplete.

Secondly, no full constraint derives an atom over named values only from an
atom with an unnamed value.  Under this assumption the named facts of the
universal model are those of the chase of full constraints.  A query atom
that the rewriting must replace then stands for an atom with an unnamed
value, so it has a variable out of the head: the rewritings left out are
those that only re-derive named facts, and XRewrite's completeness argument
[Gottlob2014]_ goes through with the remaining steps.  The constraints of the
parser satisfy it, with one exception: an ``allValuesFrom`` on a property to
which a ``hasValue`` restriction or an annotation gives a constant.  There,
an unnamed ``x`` with ``C(x)`` and ``p(x, v)`` makes ``D(v)`` hold for the
named ``v``, and NeuroLang does not find it.  An ``intersectionOf`` was such
a case, as ``aux(x, y) → B(x)``, and is now read as ``C(x) → B(x)``.

Finally, the rewriting ends.  It does on (I) and on (III), with 333
rewritings for ``ro:has_part`` and 615 for ``ro:part_of``.  On random
ontologies of 4 classes whose full constraints are not recursive, the
answers of 1,080 random queries of 1 to 3 atoms match those of a chase with
unnamed values bounded at depth 6; 120 of them are the test
``test_certain_answers_on_random_horn_ontologies``.  With four checks
running at once, three of the 1,080 took between 5 and 11 s, and one more
than 5 minutes, alone: its two atoms over
variables out of the head, ``C3(y)`` and ``C2(x)``, are rewritten
independently and their alternatives multiply.  The rewriting need not end
at all when recursive ``allValuesFrom`` constraints apply to a variable out
of the head, as ``C1 ⊑ ∀p.C2``, ``C2 ⊑ C1`` and ``C1 ⊑ ∃p.C3`` with the
query ``ans(y) :- C3(z), p(z, y)``.

One more limit concerns rules.  XRewrite rewrites each rule of the program
on its own, so an unnamed value does not pass from one rule to another:
with ``heads(x, y) :- headOf(x, y)``, ``ans(x) :- heads(x, y)`` returns Ana
and not Juan, as ``y`` is in the head of ``heads``.  ``heads(x) :- headOf(x,
y)`` returns both.  These assumptions delimit the guarantee: complete
answers for Horn ontologies without constants reached through
``allValuesFrom``, for queries whose rewriting ends.

Negation and aggregation
------------------------

Negation and aggregation are evaluated on the relations NeuroLang derives:
the chase of the full constraints and the rewritten rules.  They are closed
world over those derived facts, not over the worlds of the ontology.  On
(I), with a relation ``person`` holding Juan, Ana and Eva,

.. code-block:: neurolang

   leads(x) :- headOf(x, y), Unit(y)
   ans(x) :- person(x), ~leads(x)

returns Eva: she is not known to lead a unit, which does not mean the
ontology excludes it.  ``~Unit(y)`` likewise holds of every value not
derived to be a unit.

An aggregate counts the named values of its argument, over the union of the
rewritings of its body.  ``ans(count(x)) :- headOf(x, y)`` gives 2, Ana and
Juan.  ``ans(x, count(y)) :- headOf(x, y)`` gives ``('Ana', 1)`` and no row
for Juan, whose department is unnamed: a count over an ontology predicate
is a lower bound on the count in any world of the ontology.

Ontologies and probabilities
----------------------------

The constraints apply to the deterministic rules of a program, solved
before its probabilistic ones.  A probabilistic rule reads an ontology
predicate through a deterministic rule that queries it.  On (I), with the
probabilistic fact ``funded`` holding Juan with probability 0.5 and Ana with
0.2,

.. code-block:: neurolang

   leads(x) :- headOf(x, y), Unit(y)
   ans(x, PROB(x)) :- funded(x), leads(x)

gives Juan 0.5 and Ana 0.2.  Written directly, ``ans(x, PROB(x)) :-
funded(x), headOf(x, y)`` gives only Ana, because the body of a
probabilistic rule is not rewritten.  The ontology thus acts as certain
knowledge: it defines deterministic relations, and the probabilistic layer
of [Zanitti2023]_ reasons on top of them.

What would confirm and what limits this
---------------------------------------

The completeness claim rests on an argument and on 1,080 random queries,
not on a mechanised proof.  A cross-check against an OWL reasoner, such as
HermiT or Konclude, on ontologies with instances of the Cognitive Atlas,
would test it at scale.  The termination of the rewriting on recursive
``allValuesFrom`` is not guaranteed.  A Datalog rewriting of the anonymous
part, as in the combined approach [Lutz2009]_ [Kontchakov2011]_, which
materialises one unnamed value per existential constraint and filters the
spurious answers, would remove that limit, at the cost of a filtration step
for each query.  Until then, the guarantee holds for Horn ontologies without
constants reached through ``allValuesFrom``, on queries whose rewriting
ends.
