Changelog
=========

All notable changes to NeuroLang are documented here.

Contributors: when adding a change, add an entry under *Unreleased* using the
format below, then move it to the appropriate version section when releasing.


Unreleased
----------

**New features:**

* Declarative engine registry for the ``neurolang-query`` CLI.
  Engines are defined in YAML and initialised by pluggable Python modules
  under :file:`neurolang/utils/engines/`.  Includes ``--list-engines`` for
  discovery and ``--list-predicates`` showing declarative metadata without
  data download.  (:mod:`neurolang.utils.engine_registry`,
  :mod:`neurolang.utils.engines`)

* The existing NeuroSynth and Destrieux engines were refactored into the
  new declarative system.  Engine init code moved from
  :mod:`neurolang.utils.cli` to :mod:`neurolang.utils.engines.neurosynth.init`
  and :mod:`neurolang.utils.engines.destrieux.init`.

* ``neurolang-query --list-predicates`` no longer requires downloading data;
  predicate metadata is read from the YAML engine config.

* **Datalog init** — engines can declare inline Datalog rules that run after
  the Python init via the ``datalog_init`` YAML field.  Derived predicates can
  be defined without writing Python.

* **CSV/TSV relations** — engines can load tabular data files as extensional
  predicates with the ``relations`` YAML field.  Supported formats:
  ``.csv``, ``.tsv``, ``.csv.gz``, ``.tsv.gz``.
  Relation entries may include an optional ``description`` field for
  predicate metadata shown by ``--list-predicates``.  The ``file`` value
  may be a URL for automatic download.

* **Builtins** — engines can declare ``builtins: [exp, log, startswith]``
  in YAML to register known functions as callable symbols without Python.

* **Downloads** — the ``downloads`` section fetches files from URLs
  (with optional archive extraction) before other init phases.

* **Probabilistic choices** — engines can declare uniform probabilistic
  choices declaratively with ``probabilistic_choice:`` instead of calling
  ``add_uniform_probabilistic_choice_over_set`` in Python.

* **Ontology loading** — the ``ontologies`` section loads OWL/RDF
  ontologies from URLs or local paths.

* **Atlases** — engines can declare ``atlases:`` with nilearn atlas names
  (``destrieux``, ``schaefer``, ``difumo``) and parameters.  Atlas regions
  are loaded as ``ExplicitVBR`` predicates before Datalog init rules.

* **Declarative migration** — ``exp``, ``log``, ``startswith`` symbols
  now come from YAML ``builtins`` rather than ``base.py``; the
  ``selected_study`` choice for the neurosynth engine is now declared
  in the engine YAML instead of Python init code; the ``destrieux``
  predicate is now declared in the YAML ``atlases:`` section.

* **Base symbols** — engines can set ``use_base_symbols: true`` in YAML
  to register common neuroimaging symbols (``agg_count``,
  ``agg_create_region``, ``agg_create_region_overlay``,
  ``principal_direction``, ``region_union``) automatically, without a
  Python init script.  ``region_union`` was moved into
  :func:`~neurolang.utils.engines.base.init_base_engine` as part of this
  change.

* **YAML-only engines** — the ``destrieux`` engine no longer needs a
  ``python_init`` module.  It is now fully declarative, using
  ``use_base_symbols`` and the ``atlases:`` section.  The
  :file:`neurolang/utils/engines/destrieux/init.py` module was removed.


v0.0.1 (Alpha)
--------------

Initial alpha release of NeuroLang.

**New features:**

* Datalog-based logic programming frontend (:class:`~neurolang.frontend.deterministic_frontend.NeurolangDL`)
* Probabilistic extensions with independent probabilistic facts
  (:class:`~neurolang.frontend.NeurolangPDL`)
* Tuple-generating dependencies (TGDs) for open-world reasoning
* Aggregation support (``COUNT``, ``MAX``, ``SUM``, custom callables)
* Neuroimaging integration: nibabel image loading, Destrieux atlas, NeuroSynth
* Example gallery: Destrieux gyri, sulcal queries, NeuroSynth implementation
